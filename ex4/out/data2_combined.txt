Paragraph 1: 
Sanford Koufax (born Sanford Braun; December 30, 1935) is an American former baseball pitcher who played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers from 1955 to 1966.
He has been hailed as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history.
After joining the major leagues at age 19, having never pitched a game in the minor leagues, the first half of his career was marred with inconsistency and control problems, as he posted a win–loss record of 36–40 with a 4.10 earned run average.
He was a member of World Series championship teams in both Brooklyn and Los Angeles, though he did not appear in any of the Series wins despite pitching brilliantly in the 1959 series.
After making adjustments prior to the 1961 season to improve his control and getting more regular playing time, Koufax quickly rose to become the most dominant pitcher in MLB before arthritis in his left elbow ended his career prematurely at age 30.
Koufax was an All-Star in each of his last six seasons, leading the National League (NL) in earned run average each of his last five years, in strikeouts four times, in wins and shutouts three times each, and in winning percentage, innings pitched and complete games twice each; he was the first NL pitcher in 20 years to post an earned run average below 2.00, doing so three times.
After setting the modern NL record in 1961 with 269 strikeouts, he became the first pitcher in 17 years and the first left-hander since 1904 to strike out 300 batters, with 306 in 1963.
In 1965, he set a then-major league record with 382 strikeouts (it was broken by Nolan Ryan in 1973, but remains the top mark for NL pitchers and left-handers).
He was the first pitcher to record a 300-strikeout season three times, and twice tied a modern record by striking out 18 batters in a game.
He won the Cy Young Award in 1963, 1965, and 1966 by unanimous votes, winning the Triple Crown and leading the Dodgers to a pennant in each of those years; he was the first three-time winner of the award, and the only pitcher to do so when a single award was given instead of one for each league.
He was also named the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1963, and was runner-up in 1965 and 1966, behind Willie Mays and Roberto Clemente, respectively.
Koufax was the first major league pitcher to throw four no-hitters and, in 1965, became the sixth pitcher and the first left-hander in the modern era (post-1900) to pitch a perfect game.
He was named the World Series MVP, leading the Dodgers to titles in 1963 and 1965.
He is also notable for being one of the outstanding Jewish athletes in American sports; Koufax's decision not to pitch Game 1 of the 1965 World Series because it fell on the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur, like Hank Greenberg before him, garnered national attention as a conflict between religion and society, and remains a notable event in American Jewish history.
At the time of his retirement, Koufax's career earned run average of 2.76 trailed only Whitey Ford among pitchers with at least 2,000 innings pitched since 1925; his .655 winning percentage ranked third among both left-handers and modern NL pitchers.
Despite his comparatively short career, his 2,396 career strikeouts ranked seventh in Major League history at the time, trailing only Warren Spahn (2,583) among left-handers; his 40 shutouts were tied for ninth in modern NL history.
He was the first pitcher in history to average more than nine strikeouts per nine innings pitched, and the first to allow fewer than seven hits per nine innings pitched.
At age 36, Koufax was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1972, becoming the youngest player ever elected.



Paragraph 2: 
The Dorilton is roughly "H"-shaped in plan, with recessed light courts facing south and north.
The southern light court, along 71st Street, functions as an entrance courtyard with a gateway divided into three sections.
The outer two sections of the gateway contain large wrought-iron gates, behind which was a small, "U"-shaped driveway, while the center section contains a pedestrian entrance.
The gateway also contains four limestone columns, which flank each section; the tops of the columns contain crestings and limestone spheres.
In addition, between the two center columns is a frame that surrounds the pedestrian gate, which is decorated with a shield and two cherubs.
The facade is divided into three horizontal sections, similar to the base, shaft, and capital of a column.
The base consists of the first through third stories; the shaft comprises the fourth through ninth stories; and the capital includes the top three stories.
At ground level, the building was originally surrounded by a recessed areaway, which was infilled in the 20th century.
The ground and second stories of the facade are clad with rusticated blocks of limestone, while the third story is clad with alternating limestone-and-brick bands.
The ground level contains storefronts facing Broadway.
Historical photographs indicate that the ground level facade on Broadway originally contained windows.
There is a large balcony above the third story, which is supported by heavy brackets, some of which are grouped in pairs.
The balcony also contains a balustrade, which was originally topped by red or gray terracotta vases.
The midsection is clad largely in brick, except for the corners, which have limestone quoins.
The brick was originally painted bright red.
The Broadway facade is divided into three pavilions.
There are bronze bay windows curving outward from the center of the Broadway facade and from the center of either wing on 71st Street.
The bay windows on 71st Street are flanked by depictions of the mythological figure Atlas.
The bay window on Broadway is five stories tall and is flanked by representations of women at the fourth story.
The northern and eastern elevations are faced in cheaper red brick with varying hues and textures.
The ninth story is clad with alternating limestone-and-brick bands.
At the ninth story, the southern light court is spanned by a three-centered arch, which is supported by a steel truss.
There are shields at either end of the arch, as well as deep voussoirs and a central keystone on the arch itself; the top of the arch is flat.
The tenth story once contained another balcony, decorated with a balustrade and urns.
The balcony was supported by large brackets on the ninth floor, which still exist.
The building's mansard roof is variously cited as rising two and a half stories or three stories.
The mansard was originally covered with slate, but this was subsequently replaced with tar paper.
In addition, there was formerly segmentally-arched terracotta lintels above the eleventh-story windows, as well as large terracotta lintels above the three largest dormer windows on the mansard roof.



Paragraph 3: 
Some of the copper cresting on the roof remains intact, and there are also chimneys.
Turner was born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939, in Brownsville, Tennessee, the youngest daughter of Floyd Richard Bullock and his wife Zelma Priscilla (née Currie).
The family lived in the nearby rural unincorporated community of Nutbush, Tennessee, where her father worked as an overseer of the sharecroppers at Poindexter Farm on Highway 180; she later recalled picking cotton with her family at an early age.
When she participated in the PBS series African American Lives 2 with Henry Louis Gates Jr., he shared her genealogical DNA test estimates and traced her family timeline.
Previously, she believed she had a significant amount of Native American ancestry.
Bullock had two older sisters, Evelyn Juanita Currie and Ruby Alline Bullock, a songwriter.
She was the first cousin once removed of bluesman Eugene Bridges.
As young children, the three sisters were separated when their parents relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee, to work at a defense facility during World War II.
Bullock went to stay with her strict, religious paternal grandparents, Alex and Roxanna Bullock, who were deacon and deaconess at the Woodlawn Missionary Baptist Church.
After the war, the sisters reunited with their parents and moved with them to Knoxville.
Two years later, the family returned to Nutbush to live in the Flagg Grove community, where Bullock attended Flagg Grove Elementary School from first through eighth grade.
As a young girl, Bullock sang in the church choir at Nutbush's Spring Hill Baptist Church.
When she was 11, her mother Zelma ran off without warning, seeking freedom from her abusive relationship with Floyd by relocating to St. Louis in 1950.
Two years after her mother left the family, her father married another woman and moved to Detroit.
Bullock and her sisters were sent to live with their maternal grandmother, Georgeanna Currie, in Brownsville, Tennessee.
She stated in her autobiography I, Tina that she felt her parents did not love her and that she was not wanted.
Zelma had planned to leave Floyd but stayed once she became pregnant.
Turner recalled: "She was a very young woman who didn't want another kid."
As a teenager, Bullock worked as a domestic worker for the Henderson family.
She was at the Henderson house when she was notified that her half-sister Evelyn had died in a car crash alongside her cousins Margaret and Vela Evans.
A self-professed tomboy, Bullock joined both the cheerleading squad and the female basketball team at Carver High School in Brownsville, and "socialized every chance she got."
When Bullock was 16, her grandmother died, so she went to live with her mother in St. Louis.
She graduated from Sumner High School in 1958.
After high school, Bullock worked as a nurse's aide at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.



Paragraph 4: 
An oak is a tree or shrub in the genus Quercus (Latin "oak tree") of the beech family, Fagaceae.
There are approximately 500 extant species of oaks.
The common name "oak" also appears in the names of species in related genera, notably Lithocarpus (stone oaks), as well as in those of unrelated species such as Grevillea robusta (silky oaks) and the Casuarinaceae (she-oaks).
The genus Quercus is native to the Northern Hemisphere and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa.
North America has the largest number of oak species, with approximately 160 species in Mexico, of which 109 are endemic and about 90 in the United States.
The second greatest area of oak diversity is China, with approximately 100 species.
Oaks have spirally arranged leaves, with lobate margins in many species; some have serrated leaves or entire leaves with smooth margins.
Many deciduous species are marcescent, not dropping dead leaves until spring.
In spring, a single oak tree produces both staminate ('male') flowers (in the form of catkins) and small pistillate ('female') flowers, meaning that the trees are monoecious.
The fruit is a nut called an acorn or oak nut borne in a cup-like structure known as a cupule; each acorn contains one seed (rarely two or three) and takes 6–18 months to mature, depending on the species.
The acorns and leaves contain tannic acid, which helps to guard against fungi and insects.
The live oaks are distinguished for being evergreen, but are not a distinct group and instead are dispersed across the genus.
