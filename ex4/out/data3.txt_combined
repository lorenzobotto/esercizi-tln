Paragraph 1: 
Valentino Rossi (Italian; born 16 February 1979) is an Italian former professional motorcycle road racer and nine-time Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Champion.
Nicknamed The Doctor, he is widely considered to be one of the greatest motorcycle racers of all time, with some labelling him as the greatest ever.
He has nine Grand Prix World Championships to his name, seven of which were in the premier 500cc/MotoGP class.
He holds the record of most premier class victories, with 89 victories to his name.
He won premier class World Championships with both Honda and Yamaha.
He is also the only road racer to have competed in 400 or more Grands Prix, and rode with the number 46 for his entire career.
After graduating to the premier class in 2000, Rossi won the final 500cc World Championship (becoming the last satellite rider to win the top-class title to date) and the 8 Hours of Suzuka with Honda in 2001.
He also won MotoGP World Championships with the factory Honda Team in 2002 and 2003 and continued his run of back-to-back championships by winning the 2004 and 2005 titles after leaving Honda to join Yamaha.
He lost the 2006 title with a crash in the final round at Valencia.
In 2007 he ultimately finished third overall, before regaining the title in 2008 and retaining it in 2009.
After a 2010 season marred by a broken leg and no title defence, he left Yamaha to join Ducati, replacing Casey Stoner for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, and endured two losing seasons with the Italian marque.
Rossi returned to Yamaha in 2013 and finished fourth in the standings followed by three successive runner-up positions in 2014, 2015 and 2016.
His best chance of winning a tenth title came in 2015, where he led the standings for most of the season, finishing five points behind teammate Jorge Lorenzo, the eventual champion.
2017 was the final season he achieved over 200 points in the championship and he took his final race victory at the 2017 Dutch TT at the age of 38.
After three winless seasons with the factory Yamaha team, he moved to Petronas SRT for 2021, retiring after only one season with the satellite Yamaha team and failing to achieve a podium for the first time in a career spanning 26 seasons in Grands Prix.
The dominant force in MotoGP in the 2000s, all of Rossi's seven premier class titles came in this decade, including 77 race wins and 48 pole positions.
In the ensuing 12 seasons, he managed 12 race wins and seven pole positions.
During this period, Rossi was the 6th most successful rider in terms of total race victories.
Rossi was inducted into the MotoGP Hall of Fame as an official Legend by the FIM at the awards ceremony after the conclusion of the 2021 season.
His #46 bike number was retired at the 2022 Italian Grand Prix.
Rossi owns the Racing Team VR46, which competes in both Moto2 and MotoGP as of 2022.
He also plans to be involved in and administering his motorcycle racing team VR46.
In addition to his team management role, Rossi competes full-time in GT World Challenge Europe, driving an Audi R8 LMS for Team WRT.
Marc Márquez Alentà (born 17 February 1993) is a Spanish professional Grand Prix motorcycle road racer, who has raced for Honda's factory team since his MotoGP debut in 2013.



Paragraph 2: 
Born in Cervera, Catalonia, Spain, he is nicknamed the 'Ant of Cervera' worldwide (due to his height of 1.68m), and 'el tro de Cervera' in his hometown, meaning the 'Thunder of Cervera'.
He is one of four riders to have won world championship titles in three different categories, after Mike Hailwood, Phil Read and Valentino Rossi, and is one of the most successful motorcycle racers of all time, with eight Grand Prix World Championships to his name, six of which are in the premier class.
Márquez became the third Spaniard after Àlex Crivillé and Jorge Lorenzo to win the premier class title, and is the most successful Spanish rider in MotoGP to date, with 59 wins.
In 2013 he became the first rider since Kenny Roberts in 1978 to win the premier class title in his first season, and the youngest to win the title overall, at 20 years and 266 days of age.
Márquez is often considered one of the greatest innovators of modern MotoGP racing, due to his comparatively exaggerated cornering technique of leaning so far over the bike, that he seems to be "in constant danger of sliding out".
He is the older brother of 2014 Moto3 world champion and 2019 Moto2 world champion Álex Márquez.
Márquez won the 2010 125cc World Championship, the 2012 Moto2 World Championship, and the 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 MotoGP World Championships.
He became the first rider since Kenny Roberts in 1978 to win the premier class title in his rookie season, and the youngest to secure the title overall.
In 2014 he defended his title, winning the championship with three rounds to spare, during which he won ten races in a row.
Márquez equalled the all-time Grand Prix record for pole positions at the age of 23 in 2016.
Márquez secured the 2016 title with three rounds to spare at Motegi and sealed the title at Valencia in the final round of 2017.
He then went on to win the 2018 title with three races to spare and became the third highest all time Grand Prix winner.
He secured the 2019 title with four races to spare at the Chang International Circuit in Buriram, Thailand, marking his 8th World Championship and 6th in the Premier Class.
Márquez missed almost all of the compressed and delayed 2020 season (he completed 26 laps of the first race, before falling) as well as the start of the 2021 season because of a broken right arm sustained in the 2020 season opener.



Paragraph 3: 
After returning in the 2021 season, he won three races in Germany, Austin, Misano, and had a further 2nd place in Aragon, but due to him missing the opening two, and the last two races of the season, only finished 7th overall.
Casey Joel Stoner AM (born 16 October 1985) is an Australian retired professional motorcycle racer, and a two-time MotoGP World Champion, in 2007 and 2011.
During his MotoGP career, Stoner raced for the factory teams of Ducati and Honda, winning a title for each team.
Born in Southport, Queensland, Stoner raced from a young age and moved to the United Kingdom to pursue a racing career.
After first competing internationally in 2002, Stoner became MotoGP World Champion in 2007 for Ducati.
One of Stoner's greatest talents was his ability to ride any motorcycle beyond its perceived limits, even winning races on the inferior Ducati after both Honda and Yamaha had forged ahead in development during his later racing years.
Stoner's 2007 title remained Ducati's only rider's championship until Bagnaia’s win in the premier class in 2022.
During 2008 and 2009 Stoner remained a strong contender, winning multiple races, but not being able to consistently challenge Valentino Rossi and Yamaha for the title during those seasons.
Stoner had a strong start to the 2009 season but had to miss three races due to chronic fatigue.
In 2010, Ducati failed to challenge Yamaha and Honda until very late in the season, when Stoner went out on a winning note, winning three races.
After his departure from Ducati to Honda following the 2010 season, Stoner won a second world championship title in 2011 for Repsol Honda.
The championship was won in a dominant fashion with ten Grand Prix wins and sealed by winning his home race with two races remaining.
Prior to the 2012 French Grand Prix, Stoner announced that he would retire from Grand Prix racing at the conclusion of the 2012 season.
Stoner was also the winner of his home Grand Prix of Australia on six consecutive occasions between 2007 and 2012.
Due to a crash during practice at Indianapolis, Stoner missed several races due to injury, curtailing his championship challenge for his last season.
He rounded off his MotoGP career with a remarkable sixth consecutive win in his home Grand Prix at Phillip Island and with a podium in his final race.
On 27 March 2015, HRC announced that Stoner would return to competition in a one-off ride in the 2015 Suzuka 8 Hours.
Stoner crashed out of the race due to a stuck throttle, and Honda apologized to Stoner over the technical failure that caused him to injure his ankle and shoulder.
